# sboxed: Proxy

> An incredibly tiny, Cloudflare proxy to access the s&box API with CORS

## Why was this created?

The s&box API does not allow for CORS requests - so this proxy now exists.

## How to use

You can make any s&box API request as per normal, however, using `proxy.sboxed.com`.

-   [https://proxy.sboxed.com/sandbox-asset?id=gkaf.dodgeball](https://proxy.sboxed.com/sandbox-asset?id=gkaf.dodgeball)

These responses, unlike the official API, will return requests with CORS headers.
