# sboxed: Proxy

> An incredibly tiny, Cloudflare proxy to access the s&box API with CORS

## How to use

You can make any s&box API request as per normal, however, using `proxy.sboxed.com`.

Some examples:

-   [https://apix.facepunch.com/api/sbox/menu/index](https://apix.facepunch.com/api/sbox/menu/index) â†’ [https://proxy.sboxed.com/menu/index](https://proxy.sboxed.com/menu/index)

## Why was this created?

The s&box API does not allow for CORS requests - so this proxy now exists.
